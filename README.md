# Libft
## GENERAL

This is my first project in C, about coding my first library implementing recoding some predefined functions already existent in the libc library, in order to understand and learn when is the right time to use them.

After coding all these functions, one also has an in-depth understanding of the basics of strings in C.
Libft will be used later in the following projects of the Core Curriculum from @42School.

## FUNCTIONS

Different functions from the followings headers are used:
- The ctype.h header file of the C Standard Library declares several functions that are useful for testing and mapping characters.
- The strings.h header file of the C Standard Library declares several functions that are useful for manipulating any type of arrays or pointers.
- The put-functions are useful to write to different filedescriptors and therefore into files. These functions are not part of libc and are part of the second part of the task.
- The stdlib.h header defines four variable types, several macros, and various functions for performing general functions.
- The string.h header defines one variable type, one macro, and various functions for manipulating arrays of characters.

## NORMINETTE

As all other C projects at the 42 school, the code has to written in accordance with the norm:
- only 25 lines per function
- only 5 functions per file
- the only predefined functions allowed for this project are: write, read, malloc and free.
